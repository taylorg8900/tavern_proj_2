# About this repo

This repo is meant to be where I re-create tavern-proj-GODOT (another one of my repositories), using Git and creating my own documentation to make it just way more accessible / readable / usable / useful / maintainable. I haven't done that yet because I am lazy and scared to touch my old code, but this is where that is gonna be when I get to it.
