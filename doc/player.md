# Player Actions

I need to first identify which items the player can interact with. This is on the level of which tools they use, what weapons are available to them, that sort of thing.
- Pickaxe / Axe tool
- Lantern
- Ale
- Shield
- Minecarts
- Runestones

Now, I will brainstorm potential uses for each item.
- Pickaxe / Axe tool
	- Common uses
		- Mining ores, gems, and decayed structures
		- Hitting emeies
		- Throwing at enemies
		- Slowing descents down walls, and coming to a stop
	- Less common uses
		- Starting rockslides by hitting sections of the cave which are unstable, to cut off enemies
		- Cutting ropes if enemies are climbing them
		- Climbing up ledges which are just out of reach, like ice climbing picks
		- Hanging onto walls
	- Upgrades
		- Sharpened (makes it mine ores and gems faster, or easier)
- Lantern
	- Common uses
		- Lighting up environment
- Ale
	- Common uses
		- Healing
		- Refill stamina
		- Buffs applied before mission
			- The player can brew custom beers and get some bonuses before the level starts. I think this could be a good way to reduce inventory clutter or giving the player too many hotkeys or keybinds to worry about, since we already use ale for healing and stamina anyway.
			- Damage boost
			- Speed boost
			- Increase carry capacity
			- Drunkenness (increase effect of healing and stamina further, because more drunk = more dwarven)
			- Night vision (increases how far the lantern's light goes for player)
			- Cozy (increases health regen speed - "This ale reminds me of my childhood!")
			- Chilled (reduces damage from fire, lava, etc)
			- Spicy (reduces damage from ice or something idk)
- Shield
	- Common uses
		- Blocking enemies duh
		- Movement
			- Sliding around, sledding down slopes
- Runestones
	- Common uses
		- Explosions
			- Mine type explosions
			- Grenade type explosions
			- Soft launch style explosion
			- Light (stuns, I imagine enemies in caves are sensitive to light)
		- Sight
			- Throwing into rooms to detect if there enemies
			- Keeping a glimmering light which can be seen through walls
			- Showing fastest way back to the start of the level
			- Showing where gems or loot is
			- Firespark
				- Will light up any torches, fireplaces, campfires, whatever that have line of sight to where the runestone hits to provide static light to player
		- Creating mass
			- Water
			- Lava
			- Smoke
			- Moss 
				- Just visually adds some lush to the environment to make it pretty
		- Destroying mass
			- Getting rid of water / lava / things in the way, like finding keys that go to locked doors or chests
		- Movement
			- Providing 'feather falling' when falling from large heights
			- Barricading an area so enemies cannot pass (in a magic way though)
			- Travelling through a wall or floor like an alter Q from Apex Legends
			- Teleporting to a set location (common trope in all sorts of games)
		- Remotely retrieving an object, by making the object behave like thor's hammer or something when it hits it
		- Cloaking the player
