Version 1
	- The player inherits a tavern where the minerals underneath it are used to manufacture drugs. The player sells these minerals to an organization that sells drugs, and they extort the player to go down and get more and more out of the mines as time goes on. 
	
Version 2
	- The player is a sort of mercenary dwarf, who lingers around taverns and finds local jobs available which are posted on message boards inside the taverns or by talking to patrons. You order ale before each mission, buy runestones from wizards, upgrade gear by buying from wandering merchants, etc. You are just a dwarf travelling around hoping to hit it big someday by taking these odd jobs.
	- Like soda dungeon I guess
