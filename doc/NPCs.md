# Interactable NPC's

Just like in every other game, the player will have to talk to NPC's to do things such as buy items, get upgrades, progress the story, etc. Here are some of the ones I can think of right now.

Shopkeeps

	- Wizard

	- Bartender

		- Craft custom ale by talking to this guy and giving him specific items
