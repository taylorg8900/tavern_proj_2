# Enemy types

What kind of enemies do I want to spend time creating? What kind of enemies does it make sense to include in a game where you are underground in mineshafts or caves?
- Spiders, worms, bugs
- Golems / rock elementals
- Ghosts, skeletons
	- Flaming skull that can fly around
- Fungi
- Crabs that use minerals as their shell
- Some kind of original idea of mine of an enemy that is made out of goop, or void, or something liquid-y that attaches to rocks, ores, and the like to give itself structure and a shell
- Abandoned Dwarven Automata
	- Visual effect would be steam coming out indicating future movement or whatever
	- In the mines to extract resources, but left down there and now hostile


# Basic enemies

We need to adhere to the game design principle that enemies should only be strong in one of the following categories, and not any more than that. It is frustrating if they are strong in two of the following:
- Speed
- Health
- Damage

Enemies brainstorm
- Golems / rock elementals
	- Misc ideas
		- Could be constructed out of mostly rocks, and occasionally also gems or ores, so that when they die or have special behaviors this can let the player collect treasure
			- For instance, the scraper can sometimes throw a gem instead of just a normal piece of stone
		- Procedural generation for where the gems / ores are on the golem, visual design
		- Hoarder enemy would be made of mostly gems / ores
	- Enemies
		- Hoarder
			- Like hoarder from DRG, has a lot of health but is slow and doesn't attack
			- Drops a lot of gems / minerals / ores when it dies
			- Golem
		- Behemoth
			- Confined to the room it is in, player can kill it but it really serves as an obstacle more than anything
			- So large it cannot leave the rooms
			- Game design like the warden from minecraft i guess
		- Ankle biters
			- Small golems that just run up and try to swarm player
			- Super low health
			- Wander around the map until they find you, clusters
			- Just like the little explody guys from repo, but they try to bite you
		- Shielder
			- When it sees you it hunkers down and blocks all damage from the front
			- vulnerable from the back, will stay hunkered down for a long time so you could easily kill it if there are no enemies to stop you that is
		- Regular golem
			- Just a regular ass golem
			- A little bit slower and a little bit more health than other enemies while retaining similar damage
		- Roller
			- winds up then rolls towards player
			- can make this so it destroys itself when it hits a wall? could be funny and different from enemies you have to kill
		- Scraper
			- Scrapes off pieces of itself to throw at the player
			- Stationary archer type unit thing, ranged
			- Makes a scraping sound when it scrapes off rocks from itself
		- Agape
			- My original idea of the enemy for the game
			- Rock that cannot be damaged the first time you see it, stationary, disappears when you turn back to look at it again, then will wander around and look for you
			- I would like this to function exactly like the headman from REPO, where it tries to chase you and you have to hide from it and it is super super difficult to kill and the best way to deal with it is by running the fuck away
- Ghosts / skeletons
	- Flaming skull
		- Easy to kill enemy that flies around, has fire around itself
		- Variants which either move quickly or have more health, inverse relationship between the two (Small, Medium, Large)
- Chu chus
	- like from legend of zelda twilight princess
	- these guys are jelly like things that are pretty cute and i could make them out of ale, as a way to replenish health
