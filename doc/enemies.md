# Enemy types

What kind of enemies do I want to spend time creating? What kind of enemies does it make sense to include in a game where you are underground in mineshafts or caves?
	- Spiders, worms, bugs
	- Golems / rock elementals
	- Ghosts, skeletons
		- Flaming skull that can fly around
	- Fungi
	- Crabs that use minerals as their shell
	- Some kind of original idea of mine of an enemy that is made out of goop, or void, or something liquid-y that attaches to rocks, ores, and the like to give itself structure and a shell

# Basic enemies

We need to adhere to the game design principle that enemies should only be strong in one of the following categories, and not any more than that. It is frustrating if they are strong in two of the following:
	- Speed
	- Health
	- Damage

Enemies brainstorm
	- Hoarder
		- Like hoarder from DRG, has a lot of health but is slow and doesn't attack
		- Drops a lot of gems / minerals / ores when it dies
		- Can be a golem
	- Flaming skull
		- Easy to kill enemy that flies around, has fire around itself
