I played some minecraft with Korbin and Abby today, and I was thinking about why minecraft's mining is so satisfying and why terraria's is so boring and tedious.
I asked korbin what he thought, and he said that he thinks it is more satisfying because of the little pickup noise it makes and the experience points.
Like there is a lot of fancy feedback that the player gets. I agree. I also think that Terraria is super boring because it doesn't have that feedback, and also whenever you
do actually go mining, it takes fucking forever to get an amount that is even worth anything. The only time that it is fun to go mining in Terraria is when you I'm really late game
just flying through the ore deposits, or when I had a mod installed where it would automatically mine everything and it was really satisfying seeing it get destroyed.

I should look at other games where I thought it was satisying mining stuff, or not satisfying

I almost feel like the concept of extracting loot is even more general than specifically mining, so I want to include games that do that as a concept

Not satisfying
- Palworld
	- Same as with satisfactory, minus the satisfying 'dink dink dink'
	- I had fun spamming spheres on really weak pals and condensing them in mass
	- I think how heavy everything was was super goddamn annoying and made collection resources manually really frustrating

Grey area
- Satisfactory
	- Manual mining is pretty boring, but I do like the 'dink dink dink' noise it makes at least
	- Automatic mining is kind of satisfying because you can see the ores come out and zip around on the belts, and later upgrading the miners to mk2 or mk3 is *very* satisfying
- Power wash simulator
	- The act of cleaning itself wasn't fun for me, but the sparkle that it gives you when it is done and the whole wall flashes white for a second is nice
- Deep rock galactic
	- I feel conflicted about putting it in this category
	- I feel like actually mining things like gold is kind of boring, but things that are only one hit to mine are really fun like nitra
	- I do really like dumping everything into molly
	- When I see things such as yeast cones or something that is worth a lot but doesn't take hardly any space in my inventory I really like scooping it up

Satisfying
- Rust
	- I like hitting the weakpoints on the rocks a lot, and I like the noise it makes. It's really satisfying getting that crunchy noise when it breaks, plus the bonus at the end
- Dome keeper
	- Having the veins be revealed to be really big gives a big dopamine hit, especially when I thought they would be really small initially
	- I like the sounds the gems make when you haul them back
	- Having a ton of them and moving them all around is really satisfying too, and they keep making the dink sounds when they hit stuff
	- I like having them pop out of the wall too 
- Delta force
	- Extraction shooter
	- I like messing around in the inventory and trying to maximize the amount of loot that you can carry a lot, and just hoarding wealth is pretty fun for me. 
	- I like liquidating everything I sell to become rich
	- When you come across an item that is super rare and worth a ton it hits hard bro idk what to tell you
- Skyrim
	- I really enjoy looting dungeons, when I find small items or things that are worth a lot and I know that I can sell everything later to profit big
	- Like filling up the remaining carry weight I have feels good when I have excess space and can just dump everything in
	- Dealing with deciding what to take out is kind of fun in it's own way too, because you are really trying to maximize profit
- The FINALS
	- The sound that the money makes when you finish a extract (or whatever it's called, I didn't play that much) or when you kill someone and can collect more money
- Sons of the forest
	- I liked just filling up my pack thing to the brim and shoving whatever I could find in there, like just seeing how far it would go before it made me stop putting things in
- Hollow knight
	- When the geo pops out and does the little noise when you pick it up or when it drops I like that
	- Kind of similar to Dome keeper with how it just falls on the ground and you have to scoop it up
- Noita
	- It is fun to run through a big ass pile of gold dust or gold nuggets and grab everything really fast
- Slime rancher
	- I liked sucking in the fruits and vegetables, when you sweep an area with like 7 of them and they all come to you in a burst
- Super mario galaxy
	- Getting starbits in parts of the game where they were clustered was fun because they would all fly at you at the same time like woosh
- Fortnite
	- Weakpoints
	- Whenever you would find a really nice rock or a tree that would give you more juice per amount of time or hits or whatever
		- Like a really nice boulder gives more and faster than a brick wall which barely gives any
- Breath of the wild
	- Blowing up stuff and having a ton of materials drop all at once was super satisfying
	- I liked mining ore geodes or whatever the things that stick out of walls were because when you found a nice one it was nice I sound like an idiot right now
		- Not every ore thing was good so finding a good one was extra good and fun to destroy
- Dave the diver
	- Just like with some of the other games I felt like spamming smaller items and shoving them into my inventory space when I had a ton to spare was satisfying
	- I still felt like the inventory could sometimes be a little too small though, but maybe that helped make it satisfying to put small things in idk
